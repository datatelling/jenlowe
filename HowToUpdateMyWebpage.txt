how to update my webpage!

open a terminal
cd to the website directory

git status //tells you what changed locally
git pull //gets all the changes from github - I should do this before I'm going to make changes

***look below if you get a weird message

git add [filename[ // if I have new files I want to add to be tracked (ie add to github & to the webpage)

git commit -am 'descriptive message about changes' // adds changes to a "box" locally

git push // pushes the commit to the server


























*** IF it says:
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

THEN:
sign in to github
click on website datatelling/jenlowe

profile>settings>SSH Keys
I don't have any, so:
Add new

Note: this is super wierd and probably won't happen again

Open another terminal
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub 

copy the result and paste it in Add new

(now git pull works)
