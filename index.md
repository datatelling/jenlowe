## bio

I work with data, code, words, and plants in Northern California and Buenos Aires. 

<br />

I write an occasional [Sunday Letter](https://tinyletter.com/jenlowe), which you can subscribe to here:

 I taught *Math for Artists* at NYU ITP and *Data Visualization* at SVA's Design for Social Innovation program. I was a researcher at the Spatial Information Design Lab at Columbia University. I cofounded the School for Poetic Computation and wrote the essay [Clearing Space](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/clearing-space/) about the first class at SFPC. I've spoken at SXSW and Eyeo, and contributed ideas at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. My work has been published in [*Scientific American*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/of-pacifiers-and-pearl-harbor-see-the-stuff-first-memories-are-made-of-interactive/) and covered by *The New York Times* and *Fast Company*. I cowrote [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) with Patricio González Vivo. From 2014-2016, I shared my heartbeat online as [One Human Heartbeat](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3028308/this-womans-online-heartbeat-will-make-you-think-about-big-data-and-the-quantified-self). In 2011 I made a particle motion [wind visualization](https://vimeo.com/27039654) with lidar-derived wind data; it influenced other wind visualizations.

 <br />

I'm a member of [deeplab](http://www.deeplab.net/#home), a collaborative group of researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and cultural producers. I gave this talk in 2014 as part of the deeplab lecture series — it was prescient and I'm particularly proud of it:

From 2015-2019 I was the primary caregiver for my 2 adorable kids and did a deep dive into studying Western Herbalism and Traditional Chinese Medicine, earning a 2-year Certificate in Clinical Herbal Medicine. Plant medicine is poorly understood and thus wildly underutilized in the US and I'm thrilled to be a part of the herbal resurgence. (Someone should invite me to talk about this!)

<br />

I have a B.S. in Applied Math and a Master's in Information Science.

<br />

If you'd like to hire me for data science, speaking, writing, or an herbal consultation, please email jen at jenlowe dot net.
