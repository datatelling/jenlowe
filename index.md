She cofounded the School for Poetic Computation; she wrote the essay [Clearing Space](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/clearing-space/) about SFPC. She's spoken at SXSW and Eyeo, and contributed ideas at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Her work has been published in [*Scientific American*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/of-pacifiers-and-pearl-harbor-see-the-stuff-first-memories-are-made-of-interactive/) and covered by *The New York Times* and *Fast Company*.

In a previous life, Jen was an independent data scientist and data communicator at Datatelling where she brought together people + numbers + words. For over two years, she shared her heartbeat online as [One Human Heartbeat](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3028308/this-womans-online-heartbeat-will-make-you-think-about-big-data-and-the-quantified-self).

Jen has a B.S. in Applied Math and a Master's in Information Science. Often oppositional, she's always on the side of love.
